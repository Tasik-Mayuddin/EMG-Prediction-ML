# EMG-Prediction-ML
My university FYP is the design and optimization of neural networks to predict lower extremity muscle activity (EMG) using data from another sensor (IMUs)

This repository contains the code involved in performing 
- Data extraction from open-source gait repositories,
- Signal processing (noise removal, data smoothing, fullwave rectification)
- Iterative optimization of hyperparameters (number of layers, neurons, and solvers)
- Data presentation: (Visual comparisons, RMSE, r2)
